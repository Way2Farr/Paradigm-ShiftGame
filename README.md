# Paradigm-Shift

Paradigm shift is a 3d puzzle game. You're a sticker that has fallen out of their stickerbook and you're trying to find your way back home. 

After falling out of your book, you now exist as a 3d person with the ability to "Shift" into pages and posters. Use these to navigate through gaps, find walkable surfaces, and to discover hidden paths to get through each level.

You are also equipped with your "Camera of Creation" that can place stickers and stamps along the wall to help you reach heights and distances otherwise impossible.
